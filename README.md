Learning Github

Hi,

Just learning about github.
Here after 1 year.
Is it too late for me to learn anything?
Since nobody seems to hire me, I don't know if I am ever going to make it into the world of software development.
For the time being, trying to learn new technologies, so that I can start delivering value to the society.
